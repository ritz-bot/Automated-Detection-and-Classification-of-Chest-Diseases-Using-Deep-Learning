8. **Task 8: Evaluate the Trained Deep Learning Model**

## Business Case and Problem Statement

### Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have revolutionized healthcare and medicine. Deep learning, in particular, has reached a state where it can outperform doctors and experts in detecting and classifying diseases using medical imagery. This capability is being leveraged by hospitals and research facilities to develop tools that aid doctors and improve the efficiency of medical processes.

### Objective
In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model to detect and classify chest diseases, thereby automating the process and reducing the cost and time of diagnosis. The goal is to provide an accurate and fast diagnosis from chest X-ray images, which will assist doctors in making quicker and more reliable decisions.

### Case Study
Imagine you are a deep learning consultant hired by a hospital in downtown Toronto. Your task is to automate the detection and classification of chest diseases using X-ray images. Currently, the hospital is limited by the number of available doctors for this task, leading to delays in diagnosis. By automating the process, the hospital aims to provide rapid and accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

The hospital has provided a dataset of 133 X-ray images classified into four categories:
1. Healthy
2. COVID-19
3. Bacterial Pneumonia
4. Viral Pneumonia

The requirement is to develop a model that can detect and classify these diseases in less than one minute per image.

### Importance of Data
While the provided dataset is limited to 133 images, achieving higher accuracy and better precision and recall would typically require a much larger dataset. For demonstration purposes, we will work with the provided dataset, but it is crucial to understand that more data would be necessary for a production-level solution.
